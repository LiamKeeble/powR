# powR

This is an R package in development.

Its aim is to make simulating data, statistical analyses and study power easy.

The package allows users to simulate their statistical analyses and the power of their proposed statistical analyses.

Currently, it is only possible to simulate a limited number of different types of analyses, although I am working fast to make more possible.


# Installation

The package can be installed in the usual way for an R package in developments:

```
devtools::install_github("LiamKeeble/powR")

```

# Dependencies

Current dependencies are the ggplot2 and metafor r packages. lme4 is soon to be a dependency.



# Usage 

See the 'man' folder for individual functions and their usage. Examples will soon be posted below.


# Data simulation


# Model simulation


# Power simulation


# Plotting power
